/*
Here Manager is high level class.Beacause of using interface the code has become more simpler and now we don't
have to make any changes to this class if we add further new classes.
Here according to Dependency Inversion Principle, high level module(Manager class) doesn't depend
on low level modules(Developer,QualityAssurance,GraphicsDesigner classes)
and Both depend on abstractions.
